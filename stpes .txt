here i am going to write the steps i do in this project 
and also some imp points in the project.

1- we cannot store the pictures and other things in the database directly so we need to store those things 
   in a different plase int he server and then we upload it to the coludnary

2- we make gitkeep to keep the folders that are not to be pushed in the git directly.

3- all the sensitive file that are not to be pushed are kept in the ".gitignore" .

    now the things you dont need to send to the git can be generated by gitignore generators, and there are many.

4- the dotenv files(.env) are the environmet valiables the contain imp info like the api's or the password
   that shoul not be the part of the code thus we make env to make them safe.
   we install the dotenv package that changest the port value and the info that a program asks for 
   to run is passed through the env ports thus keeping the imp info safe , means like these things are
   not written with the main code but are accesed thorough different port.

  => these are to be written inside the gitignore .

5- to make files inside a folder you can use touch command in the terminal and then write file names to make
   them as a shortcut way just saying.

6- next is the nodemon . this restarts the server whenever the files are saved. like whenever we write something 
   in the index.js it will restart the server adter saving it.

7-after commiting all the imp files or making the initial imp. files we make the folder which contains the 
  imp. things like contrillers , db (hoow to connect to the database) middle wares etc.
  we are using the mkdir command to make these folders , this command is used to make the directories. 

8- we added pritier so that the code for all the team looks same and there are no differences in the codes
   of the different people.
